# Tic Tac Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm

This repository contains a playable Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features
- Play Tic Tac Toe against a computer opponent.
- The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- Simple command-line interface.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tictactoe-ai.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```sh
    cd tictactoe-ai
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```sh
    python tictactoe.py
    ```

## Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used for decision-making and game theory. It provides an optimal move for the player assuming the opponent also plays optimally. This AI implementation uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate the best possible move.
